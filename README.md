# HTCPCP3
HTCPCP^3 is a tool to search within and navigate through Netflow data. Some preprocessing is necessary to aggregate the netflow lines per hour per source<->destination IP pair. After this the tool will let you search on IP's, protocols, amount of traffic etc. Using WebVR it allows the usage of a VR headset to navigate in a 3D virtual reality space.

Contact me if you're interested in more information.
